# Loop Currents

This is the final project's code for a Applied Linear Algebra course at FSU. it takes the matrix that represents a circuit interpreted using Loop Current's and row reduces it, then interprets the result.

**Disclaimer:**
First time using Maven, so it might not be done properly, but it does use the Efficient Linear Math Library for Java that prefers using Maven or Gradle in order to package and use it.
